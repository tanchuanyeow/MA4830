# MA4830
This projection calculation program is meant for user to calculate a set of distance of projectile based on input of either velocity or angle or height. User can easy compare the results shown by our program to obtain the best parameter for the projectile.

At the start of the program. It will ask user to choose which value they want to vary in calculation. After input of their choice, program will ask for input for constant variables, then number of values of variables they want to vary. (We had fix to maximum of 5 samples). Then, program will ask for the values which the user wish to vary. Throughout the asking of input, our program will regenerate the value user keyed in to double confirm the value. After asking input, our program will calculate the value and displayed in tabulated form.

The novelty of our program is that we will always check for the validity of user input to make sure it is keyed correctly or within the limit. Besides that, our program will also ask whether user with to continue for another set of variable or terminate the program by choosing yes or no. The whole process is very easy ask user just required to key in y/n or values for calculation. To make sure the calculation always reliable. The program will do initialization every time before asking for input to clear the previous memory.
The process, flow char, and displayed results are shown below.

However, there are also some limitation in our program which is user cannot terminate the program during the middle of calculation process unless close the whole terminal.
